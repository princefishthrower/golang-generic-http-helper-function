# golang-generic-http-helper-function

From the blog post, [Golang: A Powerful Generic REST API Helper Function](https://chrisfrew.in/blog/golang-a-powerful-generic-function-to-make-http-requests/)

The function built in that blog post is called `MakeHTTPRequest`, in [http_helper/http_helper.go](http_helper/http_helper.go) - feel free to copy or paste it into your own project, and adapt as necessary!

(This repo itself is a work in progress - really all I need to do is find an API that actually works for the PUT POST and DELETE examples, the `generic` function under question is still valid; I will update with full working examples in the coming days!)

## Usage

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/princefishthrower/golang-generic-http-helper-function.git
```

Run the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE examples:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Enjoy the delicious HTTP powerful generic-y-goodness! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž
